## 🧰 Technologies

The API is built using the **MERN stack** technologies for the backend, focusing on efficiency and asynchronous operations.

| Category | Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Runtime Environment** | **Node.js** | 
| **Web Framework** | **Express.js** | 
| **Database** | **MongoDB** |
| **Authentication** | **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** |
| **Language** | **JavaScript** |
| **Scheduling** | **node-cron** |

## ✅ Key Features Implemented

The following core functionalities and architectural solutions were implemented in the API:

* **User Authentication:** Implemented secure user sign-up and sign-in using **JWT tokens** for access management.
* **RESTful API:** Developed **RESTful API routes** to facilitate interaction with the database.
* **Database Operations (CRUD):** Established database connections and implemented **CRUD operations** for multiple essential data types (e.g., users, courses, bookings).
* **Input Validation:** Ensured data integrity and security through **input validation** using `express-validator`.
* **Error Handling:** Setup **global error handling middleware** to catch and standardize all request errors, providing consistent responses.
* **Scheduled Jobs:** Defined and managed recurring background tasks using the **node-cron** package for automated maintenance or notifications.

## 🏗️ Code Structure

The project adheres to a **layered architecture** pattern for maximum modularity and testability.

| Folder | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `routes` | Defines the API endpoints and directs requests to the appropriate controller. |
| `controllers` | Handles incoming HTTP requests, performs basic validation, and calls the relevant service layer function. |
| `services` | Contains the core business logic and acts as the **DB access layer** (abstracting direct database interaction). |
| `models` | Defines the database schemas and validation rules (using Mongoose/MongoDB). |
| `middleware` |  middleware functions, such as **authentication checks** (`auth`) and **error handling**. |
| `config` | Stores application configurations (e.g., database URI, JWT secret keys). |
| `utils` | Provides general utility functions that are reusable across the application. |
| `cron` | Contains logic for defining and managing recurring background jobs using `node-cron`. |
